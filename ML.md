# Machine Learning
Science of Computer Programming so that they can learn from data. 

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability
to learn without being explicitly programmed.

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to
some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T,
as measured by P, improves with experience E.

# Machine Learning Types
## Supervised Lerning
Supervised learning is a machine learning technique that uses labeled data sets to train artificial intelligence (AI) models to identify the underlying patterns and relationships. The goal of the learning process is to create a model that can predict correct outputs on new real-world data.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
